dashicons-picker
================

A test widgetised fork of JJJ's Dashicons plugin for WordPress.


Critical bug - NEED HELP!
================
The dashicon picker works on initial page load. But once you have selected an icon once, the icon is not added to the input field on future attempts. And the picker itself doesn't even load after clicking the "Save" button.

This appears to be related to binding. How, where, why, or what the solution to this is ... unknown to me. If you are able to help, that would be AMAZING! This is driving me insane.



Notes
================
1. Settings do not save - this is because it's a test plugin
2. This is actually part of a much larger chunk of code. I've just broken it down into this little test plugin to simplify debugging.
3. Yes I have looked up lots of information about WordPress widgets, binding, saving bla bla bla, and none of it is helping me figure this out. I'm failing to grok something very simple, and will be here for an eternity if I just keep trying to read posts on similar issues.
